    provided by ITTIA.

3.  SUBJECT MATTER OF THE LICENSE. This Agreement supersedes all
    prior agreements and integrates all proposals and representations
    between ITTIA and LICENSEE regarding all ITTIA software in
    LICENSEE’s possession for evaluation, including earlier releases,
    sealed media packages, and all related materials.

4.  LICENSE TO EVALUATE. ITTIA grants LICENSEE a limited, non-exclusive,
    non-transferable, non-sublicensable license to use the Database
    Software solely for internal evaluation and testing purposes.
    LICENSEE shall not use the Database Software for production,
    commercial deployment, or revenue-generating purposes. LICENSEE
    shall not use the Database Software, or any portion thereof, to
    develop or support a database management system or related
    technology that competes with ITTIA DB. LICENSEE may not distribute
    the Database Software in any form to any third party without
    ITTIA's prior written approval.

5.  BENCHMARK TESTING. Benchmark testing may be performed only for
    LICENSEE’s internal analysis. LICENSEE shall not disclose results of
    any benchmark test to any third party without ITTIA’s prior written
    approval. Any unauthorized disclosure of benchmark results or
    performance data will be deemed a material breach of this Agreement,
    subject to liquidated damages of maximum penalties, or actual
    damages proven by ITTIA, whichever is greater.

6.  COMPETITION RESTRICTIONS. Unauthorized use of the Software for
    competitive analysis, product comparison, or to create a derivative
    or competing database solution is strictly prohibited. Any violation
    shall: a) Trigger immediate termination of this Agreement, b)
    Subject LICENSEE to injunctive relief, and c) Require LICENSEE to
    pay damages including liquidated damages of maximum penalty plus
    reimbursement of ITTIA’s enforcement costs and attorney’s fees.

7.  REVERSE ENGINEERING. LICENSEE shall not reverse engineer,
    decompile, disassemble, or otherwise attempt to discover the source
    code, except where expressly permitted by law and only with ITTIA's
    prior written consent.

8.  THE DATABASE SOFTWARE ACCESS. Access must be restricted to
    LICENSEE’s employees or contractors with a need-to-know basis.
    LICENSEE is responsible for breaches by its employees/contractors.

9.  OWNERSHIP AND IP RIGHTS. All title, ownership, and intellectual
    property rights in and to the Software remain with ITTIA. The
    Software embodies ITTIA’s trade secrets and proprietary information.

10. EXPORT COMPLIANCE & SANCTIONS RESTRICTIONS. LICENSEE agrees to
    comply with all applicable U.S. export control and sanctions laws,
    including the U.S. Export Administration Regulations (EAR) and OFAC
    regulations. LICENSEE shall not export, re-export, transfer, or use
    the Software in Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Syria, Crimea, Donetsk,
    Luhansk, or any other country prohibited by the United States.
    LICENSEE shall not provide the Software to any person or entity on
    the U.S. Treasury SDN list, U.S. Commerce Denied Persons List, or
    other restricted lists. Any breach of this section will result in
    immediate termination and potential civil/criminal penalties.

11. WARRANTY. THE DATABASE SOFTWARE FOR EVALUATION IS PROVIDED "AS IS"
    AND WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY OF ANY KIND. ITTIA DISCLAIMS ALL OTHER
    WARRANTIES, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING THE WARRANTIES OF
    MERCHANTABILITY, AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. NO ORAL OR
    WRITTEN INFORMATION OR ADVICE GIVEN BY ITTIA, ITS DEALERS,
    DISTRIBUTORS, AGENTS, OR EMPLOYEES SHALL CREATE A WARRANTY OR IN ANY
    WAY INCREASE THE SCOPE OF THIS WARRANTY AND THE LICENSEE MAY NOT
    RELY ON ANY SUCH INFORMATION OR ADVICE.

12. LIABILITY AND INDEMNIFICATION. In no event shall ITTIA’s liability
    arising out of this agreement exceed the aggregate amount received
    by ITTIA from LICENSEE under this Agreement. THE WARRANTY AND
    LIABILITY SPECIFIED IN THIS AGREEMENT ARE FUNDAMENTAL ELEMENTS OF
    THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN ITTIA AND THE LICENSEE. ITTIA WOULD
    NOT BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THE DATABASE SOFTWARE WITHOUT SUCH
    LIMITATIONS.

13. NON-DISCLOSURE OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION. The parties agree that
    Confidential Information shall mean information covering the
    following: (i) pricing of the Database Software (ii) the Database
    Software, (iii) the technology, ideas, know-how, documentation,
    processes, algorithms, and trade secrets or associated trademarks
    with the Database Software, (iv) the LICENSEE's project and business
    details, disclosed by either of the parties to the other party under
    this Agreement. Both parties agree to maintain Confidential
    Information in confidence by using a reasonable degree of care in
    order to ensure that no unauthorized persons shall have access to
    the Confidential Information. The parties agree that the terms of
    this section shall continue in full force and effect irrespective of
    the expiration or termination of this Agreement for a period of
    five (5) years from the Effective Date (as specified below) of this
    Agreement unless otherwise specified in a future agreement between
    the parties. ITTIA and LICENSEE further agree that each party shall
    protect the existence and terms of this Agreement, including
    information about the evaluation of the Database Software in
    LICENSEE's business and terms around such use, as Confidential
    Information. Confidential Information shall not include that
    information which (i) becomes part of the public domain through no
    breach by any of the parties; (ii) is independently developed
    without the use of Confidential Information; or (iii) is rightfully
    disclosed by a third party.

14. TECHNICAL SUPPORT. During the evaluation period, technical support
    by email and telephone is available on a first-come, first-served,
    best-efforts basis.

15. U.S. GOVERNMENT RESTRICTED RIGHTS. The Database Software and
    related documentation are provided with restricted rights. Use,
    duplication, or disclosure by the Government is subject to
    restrictions. The Database software provided under this Agreement is
    commercial computer software programs and documentation developed
    exclusively at private expense. When Database Software is acquired
    by or on behalf of the Department of Defense, use, disclosure,
    modification, distribution, and reproduction are subject to the
    standard limitations and restrictions set forth in the body of this
    Agreement, and as permitted by DFAR 227.7202-1. If Database Software
    is acquired by other U.S. Government agencies or on their behalf,
    the Database Software is furnished with Limited and Restricted
    Rights as otherwise set forth herein, or as set forth in FAR
    52.227-19(b)(1) and (2) as may be required.

16. SEVERABILITY. Whenever possible, each provision of this Agreement
    shall be interpreted in such a manner as to be valid and effective
    under applicable law. If any provision is invalid, the remaining
    provisions remain enforceable.

17. LAW AND JURISDICTION. The governing law for this Agreement is the
    law of California State, the U.S.A. and any disputes which have not
    been capable of resolution by friendly negotiation shall be brought
    before the Federal Courts in Orange County, California State, USA.
    The United Nations Convention on the International Sale of Goods
    does not apply to this Agreement. Any controversy or claim arising
    out of or relating to this Agreement, or the breach thereof, shall
    be settled by binding arbitration in Orange County, California under
    the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration
    Association by one arbitrator appointed in accordance with said
    rules. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be
    entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. Notwithstanding
    the foregoing, the parties may apply to any court of competent
    jurisdiction for injunctive relief without breach of this
    arbitration provision. If any provision or provisions of this
    Agreement are determined to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable,
    the validity, legality, and enforceability of the remaining
    provisions of this Agreement will not in any way be affected or
    impaired thereby. The prevailing party in such a proceeding will be
    entitled to recover its costs and expenses, including reasonable
    attorney's fees.

18. AUDIT RIGHTS. ITTIA reserves the right, upon reasonable notice,
    to audit LICENSEE’s use of the Database Software to ensure
    compliance with this Agreement.

19. SURVIVAL. Sections regarding confidentiality, export
    compliance, competition restrictions, benchmark testing, penalties,
    and governing law shall survive termination of this Agreement.

fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded,
redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved
